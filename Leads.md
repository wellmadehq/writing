This time, I wanted things to be different.

Meanwhile, support from third-party developers is as low as it’s ever been for a Nintendo gaming machine.

> In Britain, a beloved institution is facing calls for a radical overhaul. No, not the monarchy, or the House of Lords, or the BBC, or even the unwritten constitution. The pillar of culture currently being agonized over, upon which the nation’s identity rests, is the James Bond franchise, and the question of which actor might next be chosen to play the titular spy. Will Brits finally be ready to cast aside old prejudices and embrace diversity? Might the next 007 be … a redhead?

# Ironic, and completely counter to audience's sensibility

> Pretty great final two minutes of Game of Thrones season 5, huh?
